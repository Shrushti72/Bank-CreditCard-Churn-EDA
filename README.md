## 📌 Overview
End-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis** on a bank credit card customer 
dataset to identify churn drivers and deliver actionable retention 
recommendations — simulating real-world financial consulting analysis.

## 🎯 Business Problem
A retail bank is losing credit card customers at a **16% annual rate.**
This analysis answers three critical business questions:

## 🔍 Key Findings
| Finding | Business Impact |
|---------|----------------|
| 16% overall churn rate | ~$484,500 in replacement costs |
| <40 transactions = churn signal | Strongest early warning indicator |
| 3+ months inactivity = churn signal | Trigger point for retention outreach |
| Low credit utilization = disengagement | Card not delivering value |
| Female & single customers churn more | Segment-specific campaigns needed |
